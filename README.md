# CLI Development in TypeScript

###### Having Fun Creating a CLI for a Simple Task

Hello, hello, hello!

I really wanted to keep this blog updated, writing tech stuff and so on, but believe me, when your main source of income is being a chef running a kitchen at a hotel, which is an iconic establishment in a small, charming town in the south of Iceland, your writing resources get drained.

Writing articles is not like writing code. In fact, since my last post, I have written a lot of TypeScript and Rust, and I have reached the point where itâ€™s time to share it with you.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): A distributed version control system to track changes in your code.
- Linux or macOS: Unix-like operating systems. Node.js development is commonly done on these systems.
- An IDE or any text editor of your choice. Some popular open-source options include:
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [Atom](https://atom.io/)
  - [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
  - [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
  - [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
  - [Zed](https://zed.dev/) (for macOS)

I assume that you have knowledge on how to install and set up your environment.
